My personal project is a portfolio website that I created using Next.js and Tailwind. The website showcases my skills, work experience, and projects, as well as dedicated pages for each project with a brief description of each. With its clean and minimalist design, the website provides a comprehensive overview of my professional experience and expertise, making it easy for potential employers or clients to get a sense of my capabilities. The dedicated project pages allow visitors to delve deeper into each project, exploring the technologies used, the challenges faced, a demo and code link, and the solutions implemented. Overall, my portfolio website is an excellent tool for showcasing my skills and experience and establishing my professional brand online.
